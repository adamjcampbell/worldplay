## ABILITIES  
STR: Brawn, prowess & resistance.
DEX: Dodging, sneaking & reflexes.
WIL: Persuasion, intimidation & magic.

## SAVES
Roll a d20 equal to or under an ability.  
1 is always a success, 20 is always a failure.

## HIT PROTECTION  
HP indicates a PC’s ability to avoid getting hurt. It is lost during combat & recovered after a few moment’s rest.

## INVENTORY
PCs have 10 inventory slots: four on their body and six in their pack (which can be converted to a sleeping bag if emptied). Most items take up one slot, but smaller items can be bundled. Bulky items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry. Filling all ten item slots reduces a PC to 0 HP. PCs cannot carry more than their inventory allows, though transport can provide additional storage.

## DEPRIVATION
Deprived PCs cannot recover HP. If deprived for more than a day, they add a Fatigue to inventory. Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they can recover in safety. This effect is cumulative.

## HEALING
A moment’s rest and a swig of water will restore lost HP, but may leave the party vulnerable. Ability loss requires a week’s rest and the aid of a skilled healer.

## FUNCTORS
Functors apply a single function upon the world and take up one item slot. Anyone can be a apply a functor by holding the Functor in both hands and allowing their mind to act as the processor for the complex mathematics within. Applying a function adds Fatigue to the PC’s inventory.

If the PC is deprived or in danger, the Warden may require a PC to make a WIL save to avoid any ill-effects from application of the function.

If permitted by the Arbiter the parameters of a functor may be altered to produce a variant effect. For example a reversal of effect, more targets, increase in power etc. Applying an altered function also requires a WIL save.

## MOVEMENT

### CLOSE
If you can reach it with your fingers, just standing there, it’s CLOSE. This is toe-to-toe range, sword-fighting distance, and no move is needed to use or interact with CLOSE things.

### NEAR
A few hurried steps get you to NEAR things. Imagine NEAR as being a few seconds away, things within the radius of a glow-stick in darkness, the distance of a quick-draw, or how far you can move in a turn and still have time for an action.

### FAR
Well beyond NEAR, FAR takes you several seconds to run. The distance of a basic bowshot, as far as throwing a baseball, or a very challenging pistol shot. If you want to move FAR on your TURN, it will take the entire TURN to do so. An explosion with a FAR radius would be a huge blast! Look out!

### OUT OF RANGE
Beyond FAR, as you play out a scene, is a distance you can’t reach in one TURN of movement, and none of your effects can reach. OUT OF RANGE defines the area in which most of the current action is happening, or you might want to move OUT OF RANGE of enemy fire! Even your allies cannot help you if you are OUT OF RANGE, so be careful splitting the group!

## ACTIONS
On their turn, a character may move NEAR and take up to one action. Actions may include using a functor, attacking, making a second move (allowing you to move far), or other reasonable activities. Actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously. Whenever turn order is uncertain, the PCs should make a DEX save to see if they go before their enemies.

Retreating from a dangerous situation always requires a successful DEX save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

## COMBAT
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target’s Armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent’s HP.

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target’s Armor value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn. No one can have more than 3 Armor.

Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage. If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result. If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the highest.

If an attack is impaired, the damage die is reduced to 1d4, regardless of weapon. If the attack is enhanced, the attacker rolls 1d12. Attacks with the blast quality affect all area targets, rolling separately for each.

## DAMAGE
If an attack reduces a PC’s HP exactly to 0, the PC receives a scar (table to come).

Damage that reduces a target’s HP below 0 decreases their STR by the remainder. They must then make a STR save to avoid critical damage. Failure takes them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having 0 STR means death; having 0 DEX is paralysis; having 0 WIL is delirium.

# Ability Scores
Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), and Willpower (WIL).

When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character’s ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

# Hit Protection
Roll 1d6 to determine your PC’s starting Hit Protection (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat.

HP does not indicate a character’s health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long. If an attack takes a PC’s HP exactly to 0, the player must roll a d12 to determine their Scar.

# Fracture
An exploded planet of surviving fractured landmass locked in stasis, anchored to a black hole. Fracture itself rotates around a Red Dwarf, bombarded by the debris of a shattered solar system of which it is the only thing large enough to be called a 'planet'. Life is tough bunkered in the structures of a world lost. Still the survivors of Fracture work to make ends meet for however long the outposts hold.

The isolated bastion of the elite, an alloy metropolis impenetrable, island of abundance and decadence. Free from Fracture which feeds off scraps and is grateful, consumes the relics of times forgotten to bestow that privilege. When Hyperion moves, those who can watch, and evade, lest they become obstacles removed.

# NULL's Embrace
Worshippers of the black hole at the center of Fracture anoint it as the deity NULL. Seen as both provider and consumer of life NULL is praised for miracles and bargained with after atrocities. The enlightened devout eventually decide to make 'the journey' to NULL's embrace, leaving the safety of their outposts to feel NULL's pull and unite with the void. All things will eventually return to NULL.
